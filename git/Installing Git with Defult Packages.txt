## Git 기본 설치

```shell
$sudo apt update
$sudo apt install git
```

cd git-*
Now, you can make the package and install it by typing these two commands:

make prefix=/usr/local all
sudo make prefix=/usr/local install
To ensure that the install was successful, you can type git --version and you should receive relevant output that specifies the current installed version of Git.

Now that you have Git installed, if you want to upgrade to a later version, you can clone the repository, and then build and install. To find the URL to use for the clone operation, navigate to the branch or tag that you want on the project’s GitHub page and then copy the clone URL on the right side:

git copy URL

At the time of writing, the relevant URL is:

https://github.com/git/git.git
Change to your home directory, and use git clone on the URL you just copied:

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/git/git.git
This will create a new directory within your current directory where you can rebuild the package and reinstall the newer version, just like you did above. This will overwrite your older version with the new version:

cd git
make prefix=/usr/local all
sudo make prefix=/usr/local install
With this complete, you can be sure that your version of Git is up to date.
